Medical Diagnostics Using Deep Learning

For now, simple CNN integrated with Docker.


##To do:
- If necessary, set-up GPU avaliability for docker containers + integrate w. model
- Look at how to export singular images
- Docker vs-code development integration
- Wandb as visual set-up? (Are there issues with that?)
- Data-augmentation, if not enough training images or just to explore
- what CNN to choose?
- How do we test?
- Attention mechanisms(heatmaps of diagnostics)
- Load data
